Areas for Potential Enhancement
Based on the files, some areas you might consider expanding:
1. Advanced collaboration features (pull requests, code reviews)
2. Issue tracking system
3. Enhanced merge conflict resolution
4. Webhooks and integrations
5. User notifications
6. Advanced permission system
7. File preview for different file types
8. CI/CD integration

Potential Improvements

Error Handling: Your CLI could benefit from more robust error handling and user-friendly error messages.
File Diff: GitHub CLI shows diffs when committing; you could add this functionality.
Local Config: Your .codeshare directory approach is good, but consider making it more persistent across sessions.
Authentication Flow: Consider adding refresh tokens for better security.
Command Parity: You could add more GitHub-like commands such as:

status: Show working tree status
log: Show commit history
diff: Show changes between commits
merge: Merge branches



Overall, your implementation provides a solid foundation for a GitHub-like CLI experience but with your own custom approach to version control.
